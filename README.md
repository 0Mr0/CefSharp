# CefSharp - Embedded Chromium for .Net

This project contains .Net CLR bindings for The [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/ "Google Code") by Marshall A. Greenblatt. The bindings are written in C++/CLI but can be used from any CLR language e.g. C# or VB. CefSharp provides both WinForms and WPF web browser control implementations. See the CefSharp.WinForms.Example or CefSharp.Wpf.Example projects for example web browsers built using this library.
