CefSharp - Embedded Chromium for .Net applications.

This project contains .Net CLR bindings for The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) by Marshall A. Greenblatt.

The bindings are written in C++/CLI but can be used from any CLR language e.g. C# or VB.  
See the CefTest project for an example web browser built using this library.

NEWS
====

2010/12/03 - 0.1 Released 
=========================
    - BrowserControl user control
    - Load, Forward, Back, Stop, Go
    - INotifyPropertyChanged notification for navigation events CanGoForward, CanGoBack etc.
    - ExecuteJavascript, works but needs polish
    - Interception of resource loading, loads from System.IO.Stream

    Enough to build a poor man's web browser and call a bit of JavaScript. Coming soon, more features including the ability to bind .Net object straight into the browser's V8 JavaScript context.
