CefSharp - Embedded Chromium for .Net applications.

This project contains .Net CLR bindings for The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) by Marshall A. Greenblatt.

The bindings are written in C++/CLI but can be used from any CLR language e.g. C# or VB.  
See the CefTest project for an example web browser built using this library.
